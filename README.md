This is MewTheCrazY's Guud Rally game 1.0

Feel free to modify, share, and play it.

To play, simply use the compiled exe file, or launch it using Python.(requirements in source)
You also need to download materials and place the folder to exe, or main.py directory.

Written in Python, tested with Python 2.7.5 (may not work with newer (3.xxx) versions
Everything was created by me, MewTheCrazY, except game2exe.py, wich is taken from this link: http://www.pygame.org/wiki/Pygame2exe?parent=CookBook
